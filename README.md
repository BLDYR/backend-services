# BLDYR Project
  * It's like Task Rabbit but for high-end PC builders.
  * WIP - Documentation

## Usage Instructions
  * When setting up the project for the first time:
    * `cd` into the project's root directory
    * `bin/setup`
    * ... WIP

## Notes
  * Editing/renaming dockerfiles requires changes in multiple locations
    * Dockerfile
    * docker-compose.yml
  * Need a config or constants layer for ports, symlinks, secrets, etc...
  * Watchers pending (webpack-dev-server, nodemon, docker watcher, etc...)
  * CI/CD integrations pending
  * Run book pending - this is super low priority for now
